# databaseclass
This project provides a full extension for PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) class designed for ease-of-use and saving
development time/effort. This is achived by providing methods - delete, insert, select, select a row, update  and 
other PDO property - for quickly building common SQL statements, handling exceptions when SQL errors are produced,
and automatically returning results/number of affected rows for the appropriate SQL statement types.<br>
I will publish examples coming soon.
